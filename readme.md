# üåê E-Commerce Landing Page

## Overview

This project is a responsive e-commerce landing page designed to showcase products and engage visitors. It is currently a work in progress, as I plan to redo the site to improve its structure, optimize responsiveness, and learn backend integration.

## Current Features

- **Responsive Design (In Progress):** Initial attempt to create a responsive layout using CSS, but it needs refinement, especially for larger screens.
- **Custom Animations:** Includes interactive CSS animations such as a circle animation on hover and color transitions.
- **Sliders Without JavaScript:** Learned how to create sliders purely with CSS, avoiding JavaScript for basic functionality.
- **Semantic HTML:** Utilized semantic elements to ensure proper HTML structure.

## Lessons Learned

- **Importance of Clean Code:** Through this project, I realized the significance of maintaining clean, organized code. The initial version became a mess due to excessive use of media queries, prompting me to plan for a complete redo.
- **Responsive Design Challenges:** The first attempt at making the site responsive involved many media queries, which taught me about better practices in responsive design.
- **HTML Structure Optimization:** Recently, I started reworking the header HTML to improve semantic structure and ensure better accessibility.
- **CSS-Only Solutions:** I explored how to implement sliders and other interactive elements without relying on JavaScript, which was a valuable learning experience.

## Plans for Improvement

- **Refactoring CSS:** I intend to refactor the CSS to make it more maintainable and scalable, focusing on a cleaner, more modular approach.
- **Backend Integration:** As part of the redevelopment, I aim to learn backend development concepts such as working with APIs and JSON, and integrating these into the site.
- **Improved Responsiveness:** The site currently does not function well on larger screens, so a priority will be to enhance its adaptability across all device sizes.


## Future Goals

- Complete the refactoring of HTML and CSS.
- Learn and integrate backend technologies to enhance the site's functionality.
- Ensure full responsiveness across all device types and screen sizes.
